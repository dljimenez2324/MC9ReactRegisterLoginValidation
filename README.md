<bold>Notes:<bold/><br>
*   I noticed that I have to use htmlFor  instead of for with labels when creating forms... see below  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22752116/react-ignores-for-attribute-of-the-label-element
*   Example for autocomplete and how to create a form... see below  https://web.dev/learn/forms/autofill/?utm_source=devtools#how-does-autofill-work
